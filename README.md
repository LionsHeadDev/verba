# Verba - French Learning App <img src="https://flagcdn.com/fr.svg" width="25" alt="French Flag" />

Verba is a project I’m building to actually teach French in a simple, structured way, with no ads or gimmicks. 
Even if you're an absolute beginner or someone with advanced knowledge of French, Verba will cover everything, including greetings, grammar, and slang, to help you master French.

### Why I’m making this
I wanted something that feels like an easy book you can actually follow, but interactive: read a rule, see examples, and try a short quiz.  
At the same time, this project is my playground to practice full-stack development and learn how to build and ship real apps.
