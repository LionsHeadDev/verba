# Verba - French Learning App <img src="https://flagcdn.com/fr.svg" width="25" alt="French Flag" />

Verba is a project I’m building to actually teach French in a simple, structured way with no ads.  
Just lessons that explain greetings, grammar, slang, and how native French people really speak.

### Why I’m making this
I wanted something that feels like an easy book you can actually follow, but interactive: read a rule, see examples, try a short quiz.  
At the same time, this project is my playground to practice full-stack development and learn how to build and ship real apps.
