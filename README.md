# Verba - French Learning App <img src="https://flagcdn.com/fr.svg" width="25" alt="French Flag" />

A small, personal project to help me actually learn French, the app uses flashcards and a spaced-repetition idea so that words that matter stick. 

This started as something simple I could finish from start to finish. It's intended to be useful for me or anyone who wants a clean, ad-free way to learn basic French vocabulary and phrases. Eventually, it will be a web PWA, a tiny downloadable desktop app, and if I get there, a mobile-friendly app for both iPhone and Android.

## Why I built this
I learn faster when I build tools I use every day. This is both a study tool and my playground for practicing full-stack development, encompassing UI, data persistence, and deployment. I want something I'll keep coming back to and something I can show on GitHub that actually works.
