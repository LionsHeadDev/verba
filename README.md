# Verba - French Learning App <img src="https://flagcdn.com/fr.svg" width="25" alt="French Flag" />

Verba is a small personal project to help me (and others) truly learn French from the ground up.  
no ads, no basic learning, Verba is designed like an interactive free book: simple, structured lessons that teach greetings, grammar rules, slang, and real conversation flow.  

The goal is to move beyond mere memorization of words. With Verba you’ll:
- **Learn step by step** – from the basics to more advanced grammar
- **Understand how French really works** – sentence structure, verb forms, and patterns
- **Pick up real-world slang and expressions** – the way people actually talk
- **Practice and test yourself** – short quizzes and exercises to make sure it sticks

## Why I built this
This project is also my full-stack playground. I’m building it to practice web development while creating something genuinely useful.  
Eventually, Verba will grow into:
- A **web app** (PWA) you can install offline  
- A **desktop app** (via Tauri)  
- And maybe one day, a **mobile app** for iOS and Android.
